<p>TikTok, a profoundly popular social media platform based on shortform
video content, was recently the subject of <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protecting_Americans_from_Foreign_Adversary_Controlled_Applications_Act">H.R.7521
- Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications
Act</a>. The law, which explicitly names TikTok and demands a “qualified
divestiture as determined by the president”, was recently upheld by the
Supreme Court.</p>
<p>Despite the congressional justification of national security,
H.R.7521 exclusively serves monied interests with a level of gross
negligence towards national security that should disqualify the voting
majority of their seats. The US population was incentivized by sheer
congressional incompetence to move from Chinese parent company TikTok to
Chinese company <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xiaohongshu">REDnote</a> with a
colorful history of censoring criticisms of the CCP and topics related
to the liberation of people. In December 2022, the elected Taiwanese
government prohibited the usage of REDnote on public sector devices. In
the same month, congress took the exact measure against TikTok.</p>
<p>If this was truly about national security, then congress would be
focused on creating broad protections for US data that apply to all
entities rather than singling out platforms and forcefully exacerbating
the profound wealth of US tech oligarchs.</p>
<h3 id="the-actual-issue">The actual issue</h3>
<p>A nationally representative poll conducted by the Pew Research Center
in May 2023 demonstrates that the overwhelming majority of US people
have little understanding and serious concerns about what their data is
used for and feel that they have little to no control over what data is
being collected about them.</p>
<p><img src="Images/pewgraph01.png" alt="Graph from Pew Research Center showing that Americans are largely concerned and feel little control or understanding of how companies and the government collect, use data about them" style="width:500px;height:600px;"></p>
<p>Most typically, personal data collected by a profit driven company is
used to support targeted advertising efforts. When used within reason,
targeted advertising can be extremely useful. I am sure many greatly
appreciate the personalized discount alerts sent to them by their local
grocery store. However, categorically inappropriate use of massive
amounts of personal data persists within big tech companies. Extreme
prejudice in advertising and addictive content curation based on
increasingly intrusive data collection and analysis is the whole growth
model within the social media industry. The amount of data that can be
collected from the devices we use to access these platforms is
unfathomable to the common person and without government intervention,
hardware advancements will continue to support an infinite growth model.
Major players including Meta and ByteDance have made pushes into
extended reality hardware, with existing iterations of hardware packed
with external cameras and sensors capable of mapping your entire
environment and internals that monitor the movements of your eyes. The
ability to measure the attention you give to content via the movement of
your eyes would revolutionize targeted advertising and be worth
billions.</p>
<p>The slippery slope remains much steeper,</p>
