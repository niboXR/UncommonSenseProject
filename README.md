Uncommon Sense Project

This is the home for my uncommon sense project. This is a broad in scope public policy project aimed at informing the public of common sense solutions and advocating for action to reform our congressional body.

Credit to my partner for helping me come up with the name, for all the bathroom talks, and everything I know you will do to support this project.

You can find the project homepage [here](https://uncommonsenseproject.com).
