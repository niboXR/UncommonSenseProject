    <h1>The 47th administration</h1>
    <h6>This journal was written by <a href="bio.html">Nick B</a></h6>

   <p>For now, my thoughts about the 47th U.S. President and their
   administration will be contained to this single page.</p>
   <h1 id="section">3.18.2025</h1>
   <p>The administration recently cited an 18th century law<a
   href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
   role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>, last used during WWII to place
   US citizens in internment camps without trial, as justification to
   unlawfully deport hundred of Venezuelan immigrants to El Salvadorian
   prisons. The law, which has only been used three times previously,
   grants the president extensive detention and deportation over “all
   natives, citizens, denizens, or subjects of the hostile nation or
   government”.</p>
   <p>The administration’s use of this law to deport <em>alleged</em>
   gang members is blatantly well outside of the law’s actual scope
   which explicitly applies to wars with foreign nations or governments.
   Acknowledging such, a federal court ordered a delay to the
   administration’s actions so they could go under legal review. The
   administration proceeded with the deportation regardless, calling the
   ruling itself unlawful.</p>
   <p>The president does not and should not make the law. That is the
   whole point of our constitution.</p>
   <p>In related new, the administration is trying to deport lawful
   residents for opposing a literal genocide that it supports.</p>
   <p>Whether it be through the invocation of an old racist law or
   through ignoring the law altogether, it is clear this administration
   is seeking the authority to conjure up an enemy as a means of
   detaining and deporting as they please.</p>
   <p>I say without hyperbole, you or I could be next.</p>
