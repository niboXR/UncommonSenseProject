   <p><strong>Howdy, I’m Nick B.</strong></p>
   <p>I work as a data analyst at a public research university with
   teams that use representative survey data to answer important
   questions about the public’s experiences and opinions. Prior to my
   current role, I graduated from a recognized Public Affairs program. I
   received a Master of Public Affairs degree with focuses in policy
   analysis and health policy and a Bachelor of Science in Public
   Affairs degree with major focus in law and public policy and a minor
   focus in business. I began my studies at the local community college
   and I just didn’t stop till I was buried in student loan debt.</p>
   <p>If I were to go back for more debt, my thesis would be the
   following:</p>
   <blockquote>
   <p>A people who are not systemically and increasingly deprived of
   fundamental rights would not tolerate the systemic ignorance we are
   seeing in our public officials today</p>
   </blockquote>
   <p>I’ve done the door-to-door work, I’ve seen the public opinion
   polling, and I’ve studied these issues. There are real answers that
   we agree on that our elected representatives ignore. They only get
   away with it by depriving the people they represent of the electoral
   power, financial security, and civic education needed to fight
   back.</p>
   <p><strong>This project is my attempt to fight back. I hope you stick
   around to give me a chance to prove my thesis. Nothing to lose.
   Everything to gain.</strong></p>
