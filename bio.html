    <h6>This bio was written by Nick B</h6>

   <p><strong>Howdy, I’m Nick B.</strong></p>
   <p>I work as a data analyst at a public research university. I work
   with teams that use representative survey data to answer important
   questions about the public’s experiences and opinions. Prior to my
   current role, I graduated from a recognized Public Affairs program at
   a different public university. I received a Master of Public Affairs
   degree with focuses in policy analysis and health policy and a
   Bachelor of Science in Public Affairs degree with major focus in law
   and public policy and a minor focus in business. Despite the
   pretentious titles, I began my studies at the local community college
   and I just didn’t stop till I was buried in <a
   href="student-loan-debt.html">student loan debt</a>.</p>
   <p>If I were to go back for more debt, my thesis would be the
   following:</p>
   <blockquote>
   <p>A people who are not systemically and increasingly deprived of
   fundamental rights would not tolerate the systemic ignorance we are
   seeing in our public officials today</p>
   </blockquote>
   <p>I’ve done the door-to-door work, I’ve seen the public opinion
   polling, and I’ve studied these issues. There are real answers that
   we all agree on that our elected representatives ignore at the behest
   of their owners. They only get away with it by depriving the people
   they represent of the electoral power, financial security, and civic
   education needed to fight back.</p>
   <p><strong>This project is my attempt to fight back. hope you stick
   around. Give me a chance to prove my thesis. Nothing to lose.
   Everything to gain.</strong></p>
