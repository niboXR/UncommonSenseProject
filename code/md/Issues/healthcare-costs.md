summary: The cost of healthcare is a health rights issue related to managing the costs of providing healthcare. The amount spent on healthcare in the U.S has risen exponentially year over year and we spend far more relative to the rest of the world. Reducing what we spend starts by eliminating the profit motive and administrative burden of for-profit insurers and monopolistic hospital systems. Ensuring free access to preventive services and medicine will further reduce expensive medical episodes. The costs of prescription drugs can be addressed through Medicare price negotiation and more aggressively pursuing generic availability.

The cost of healthcare is a health rights issue related to managing the costs of providing healthcare. The amount spent on healthcare in the U.S has risen exponentially year over year and we spend far more relative to the rest of the world. Reducing what we spend starts by eliminating the profit motive and administrative burden of for-profit insurers and busting up monopolistic hospital systems. Ensuring free access to preventive services and medicine will further reduce expensive medical episodes. The costs of prescription drugs can be addressed through Medicare price negotiation and more aggressively pursuing generic availability.
