**Voter rights** guarantee *citizens* **the ability to participate freely, fairly, and equally in elections**

# Rationale

From the Declaration of Independence:

> That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, --That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness.

Free, fair, and equal elections is the only way to ensure the people consent to governance and that governance reflects the will of the people.
