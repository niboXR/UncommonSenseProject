| [The cost of healthcare](healthcare-costs.md)              | The cost of healthcare is a health rights issue related to managing the costs of providing healthcare. The amount spent on healthcare in the U.S has risen exponentially year over year and we spend far more relative to the rest of the world. Reducing what we spend starts by eliminating the profit motive and administrative burden of for-profit insurers and monopolistic hospital systems. Ensuring free access to preventive services and medicine will further reduce expensive medical episodes. The costs of prescription drugs can be addressed through Medicare price negotiation and more aggressively pursuing generic availability. |

| [Unwarranted mass surveillance](surveillance-govt.md)      | *[Data rights](data-rights.md)* protect people from the unauthorized use of their personal information. The government has exploited section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act to conduct warrantless surveillance of U.S. citizens and section 215 of the Patriot Act to engage in mass surveillance of phone and email records, internet searches, and credit card transactions. These provisions should be repealed, privacy laws should be modernized, and records obtained without a warrant should be destroyed.                                                                                                                 |
| [Commercial surveillance](surveillance-commercial.md)      | *[Data rights](data-rights.md)* protect people from the misuse of their personal information. Technology companies have become increasingly hostile in their collection and monetization of our data with little respect for privacy. This trend, combined with grossly inadequate protections, is increasingly worrisome as advances in technology rapidly expands the information these companies are capable of collecting. Congress MUST enact digital privacy protections that shifts decision-making back to the people.                                                                                                                        |
