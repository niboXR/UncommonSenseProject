**Rights** guarantee *people* **the ability to pursue life, liberty, and happiness**

# Rationale

> "We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness" [^1]

We have made some progress since the Declaration was signed in 1776, but these self-evident truths have yet to be meaningfully realized in law or policy. Congress must begin to make law and policy in accordance with a common sense interpretation of these unalienable rights. **If congress maintains course, the people must demand better.**

# Notes

While many of the rights we cover will also have solid legal footing within the United States and internationally that we will discuss for context, the guiding principles will always be life, liberty, and happiness.
