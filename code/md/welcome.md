**This project is focused on securing the *rights* of people living in the United States through common sense public policy and law**

Public trust, the percent who say they trust the government to do what is right at least most of the time, peaked around 1964 at 77 percent. That public trust had eroded to under 25 percent by 2007 and has hovered around 20 percent for nearly two decades. [^1] **That means that despite nine major federal elections, only 1 in 5 people can ever trust our government.**

When looking at the historical approval ratings of our elected branches of government, congressional approval ratings [^2] are consistently well below that of the president [^3]. This pattern likely reflects sustained congressional inaction on issues and solutions with public and scientific agreement. The trend also helps explain our recent turn toward increased executive power with it being made damagingly clear that **a large portion of the public feel that the only thing worse than executive overreach is congressional inaction.** 

Now faced with unprecedented executive overreach that **will exacerbate the issues** faced by people living in the United States, restoring sense to Congress is our most immediate remedy. In 1776, Congress wrote:

> "We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, **it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it**, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness." [^4]

**This project asserts that congress has become a destructive force that can and should be fundamentally altered in the radical pursuit of life, liberty, and happiness**
