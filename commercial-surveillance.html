    <h6>This issue was written by Nick B (see author <a
href="bio.html">bio</a>)</h6>

   <p><a href="data-rights.html">Data rights</a> should protect us from
   the misuse of our personal data but technology companies have become
   increasingly hostile in their collection and monetization of our data
   with little respect for privacy. This trend, combined with grossly
   inadequate protections, is increasingly worrisome as advances in
   technology rapidly expands the information these companies are
   capable of collecting. Congress MUST enact digital privacy
   protections that shifts decision-making back to the people.</p>
   <h1 id="what-is-the-issue">What is the Issue?</h1>
   <p>Our personal data is extremely valuable. This quote from the
   executive summary of a 2024 report on the social media industry<a
   href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
   role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> helps explain how:</p>
   <blockquote>
   <p>“By leveraging user data for targeted advertisements, where most
   revenue is derived, sites have been able to capitalize on the
   popularity of their platforms. As a result, industry revenue has
   surged at a CAGR of 20.3% over the past five years, including a climb
   of 12.0% to total an estimated $104.9 billion in 2024 alone.”</p>
   </blockquote>
   <p>According to the same report, the “highly concentrated” industry
   is expected to grow to nearly 250 billion dollars within the next
   five years.</p>
   <p>The data collection practices of these companies have become a
   subject of heavier scrutiny with ample evidence that the usefulness
   of targeted advertising is far outweighed by exploitative data
   practices occurring within these big tech companies. The FTC recently
   released a damning report<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref"
   id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> that included the
   following quote:</p>
   <blockquote>
   <p>The amount of data collected by large tech companies is simply
   staggering. They track what we read, what websites we visit, whether
   we are married and have children, our educational level and income
   bracket, our location, our purchasing habits, our personal interests,
   and in some cases even our health conditions and religious faith.
   They track what we do on and off their platforms, often combining
   their own information with enormous data sets purchased through the
   largely unregulated consumer data market.</p>
   </blockquote>
   <p>A major contributor to the industry’s growth is in the increasing
   amount of data that can be collected from the devices we use to
   access these platforms. The amount of data that can be harvested from
   existing smart devices is unfathomable to the common person. Without
   government intervention, hardware advancements will lead to
   unimaginable invasions of privacy. Major players in the industry
   including Meta and ByteDance have made pushes into extended reality
   hardware, with the current generation of hardware packed with
   external cameras and sensors capable of mapping your entire
   environment and internals that monitor the movements of your eyes.
   The ability to measure the attention you give to content via the
   movement of your eyes will be worth billions to these companies and
   come at a huge cost to people. The conflict of interest here is
   apparent and will inevitably lead to extreme prejudice in advertising
   and addictive content curation based on increasingly intrusive data
   collection and analysis.</p>
   <p>The American people do not understand or want this outcome. A
   nationally representative poll conducted by the Pew Research Center
   in May 2023 demonstrates that the overwhelming majority of US people
   have little understanding and serious concerns about what their data
   is used for and feel that they have little to no control over what
   data is being collected about them. <a href="#fn3"
