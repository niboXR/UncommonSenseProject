<h1 id="data-rights">Data Rights</h1>
<p>A nationally representative poll conducted by the Pew Research Center
in May 2023 demonstrates that the overwhelming majority of US people
have little understanding and serious concerns about what their data is
used for and feel that they have little to no control over what data is
being collected about them.</p>
<p><img src="images/pewgraph01.png" alt="Graph from Pew Research Center showing that Americans are largely concerned and feel little control or understanding of how companies and the government collect, use data about them" style="width:500px;height:600px;"></p>
<p>Most typically, personal data collected by a profit driven company is
used to support targeted advertising efforts. When used within reason,
targeted advertising can be extremely useful. I am sure many greatly
appreciate the personalized discount alerts sent to them by their local
grocery store. However, categorically inappropriate use of massive
amounts of personal data persists within big tech companies. Extreme
prejudice in advertising and addictive content curation based on
increasingly intrusive data collection and analysis is the whole growth
model within the social media industry. The amount of data that can be
collected from the devices we use to access these platforms is
unfathomable to the common person and without government intervention,
hardware advancements will continue to support an infinite growth model.
Major players including Meta and ByteDance have made pushes into
extended reality hardware, with existing iterations of hardware packed
with external cameras and sensors capable of mapping your entire
environment and internals that monitor the movements of your eyes. The
ability to measure the attention you give to content via the movement of
your eyes would revolutionize targeted advertising and be worth
billions.</p>
