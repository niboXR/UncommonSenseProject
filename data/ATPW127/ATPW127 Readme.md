NOTES

This dataset contains the variables corresponding to questions asked in the survey. It also contains administrative data, such as the main production weight and completion date. There are several types of additional variables that we can typically provide upon request, if they were created for published reporting: 
(1) Researcher-created variable(s) reflecting how we categorized responses to open-ended questions. We do not release verbatim answers to open-ended questions, in the interest of protecting panelist anonymity.
(2) Researcher-created variables needed to replicate published analysis (e.g., an index using several questions).
(3) Special weights needed to replicate published analysis. The main production weight is included in the public dataset. Special weights refer to those used for unusual, bespoke analysis. We can provide existing special weights upon request so long as the analysis they support does not pose a risk to panelist anonymity. 
If you would like to request any of these variables, or have any questions, please reach out to us at info@pewresearch.org.

DKQ6/DIGHABT2b
Due to an error in the question wording, results from DKQ6 and DIGHABT2b were not reported and these variables have been removed from the data.

DB1b
After data collection, all internet-provided panelists (a.k.a. tablet panelists) who were asked DB1b were coded as "3. No (Offline: does not have internet, back coded)" for consistency with Wave 49.

For a small number of respondents with high risk of identification, certain values have been randomly swapped with those of lower risk cases with similar characteristics.
