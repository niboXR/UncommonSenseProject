    "text": "This project is focused on securing the rights of people living in the United States through common sense public policy and law\nPublic trust, the percent who say they trust the government to do what is right at least most of the time, peaked around 1964 at 77 percent. That public trust had eroded to under 25 percent by 2007 and has hovered around 20 percent for nearly two decades. 1 That means that despite nine major federal elections, only 1 in 5 people can ever trust our government.\nWhen looking at the historical approval ratings of our elected branches of government, congressional approval ratings 2 are consistently well below that of the president 3. This pattern likely reflects sustained congressional inaction on issues and solutions with public and scientific agreement. The trend also helps explain our recent turn toward increased executive power with it being made damagingly clear that a large portion of the public feel that the only thing worse than executive overreach is congressional inaction.\nNow faced with unprecedented executive overreach that will exacerbate the issues faced by people living in the United States, restoring sense to Congress is our most immediate remedy. In 1776, Congress wrote:\nThis project asserts that congress has become a destructive force that can and should be fundamentally altered in the radical pursuit of life, liberty, and happiness"

    "text": "Note\n\n\n\nThis project is about addressing longstanding issues in American public policy and law, rather than reacting to current affairs. That said, some things should be said out loud. Those things will be said here.\n\n\n\nAugust 25th, 2025\nToday, the sitting president of the United States claimed that “a lot of people are saying maybe we’d like a dictator”. This was in response to criticism of his escalating military occupation of Washington D.C. that has parents writing notes in an effort to prevent their children from being incarcerated alongside their undocumented caregivers. The president also signed several executive orders further establishing a police state, undermining constitutional rights to free speech, and depriving working class people of due process. The harassment of Kilmar Abrego Garcia continued, setting a dangerous precedent on just how far a vindictive administration can go to ruin a person’s life. And in a blatant effort to manipulate election outcomes, the DOJ is being weaponized against the state of California’s redistricting effort that is occurring as a response to the redistricting occurring in Texas at the behest of the administration.\nThe sitting president has regularly expressed admiration and jealousy of dictators . He has since moved to emulation. I am not sure the laws of this country were built to withstand a hostile takeover by the highest ranking government official emboldened by a complicit court and complacent congress.\n\n\nMarch 18th, 2025\nThe administration recently cited an 18th century law last used during WWII to place US citizens in internment camps without trial, as justification to unlawfully deport hundred of Venezuelan immigrants to El Salvadorian prisons. The law, which has only been used three times previously, grants the president extensive detention and deportation over “all natives, citizens, denizens, or subjects of the hostile nation or government”.\nThe administration’s use of this law to deport alleged gang members is blatantly well outside of the law’s actual scope which explicitly applies to wars with foreign nations or governments. Acknowledging such, a federal court ordered a delay to the administration’s actions so they could go under legal review. The administration proceeded with the deportation regardless, calling the ruling itself unlawful.\nThe president does not and should not make the law. That is the whole point of our constitution.\nIn related new, the administration is trying to deport lawful residents for opposing a literal genocide that it supports.\nWhether it be through the invocation of an old racist law or through ignoring the law altogether, it is clear this administration is seeking the authority to conjure up an enemy as a means of detaining and deporting as they please.\nI say without hyperbole, you or I could be next."
