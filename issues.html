<h2 id="defining-accuracy">Defining accuracy</h2>
<p>Objective accuracy has been obscured by the powers that be to protect
themselves from an informed populace. News media is unaccountable and
the internet is infinite. New technologies such as AI are poised to
profoundly exacerbate a collective disillusionment. Despite this
bombardment, truth is now more obtainable than ever. The internet, for
all of its harm, gives us the ability to track information to original
sources and determine their validity objectively.</p>
<p>I will frequently cite legislation and legal cases as background fact
and research from governmental and research bodies as supporting
evidence. For references to broad topics or specific events, I will
likely make full use of Wikipedia because it is an outstanding resource
maintained by a global community. As with all of the other sources,
treat the information on Wikipedia with contextual understanding. False
information can be written anywhere. It is our jobs to assess the
likelihood of truth and appropriately apply it to our broad
understanding, with no one source serving as gospel.</p>
