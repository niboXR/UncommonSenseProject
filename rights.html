    <h1>Rights</h1>
    <h6>This definition was written by Nick B</h6>

   <p><strong>Every</strong> person must be guaranteed the ability to
   pursue life, liberty, and happiness.</p>
   <h1 id="rationale">Rationale</h1>
   <p>We firmly believe in the words immortalized within the Declaration
   of Independence<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
   role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>:</p>
   <blockquote>
   <p>“We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created
   equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain
   unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the
   pursuit of Happiness”</p>
   </blockquote>
   <p>While this country has yet to achieve this fundamental promise,
   Article V of the US Constitution<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref"
   id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> establishes a path
   for realizing it through our elected representatives. It is long
   passed time that our representatives do their part or get out of the
   way.</p>
   <h1 id="notes">Notes</h1>
   <p>While many of the rights we cover will have solid legal footing
   within the United States and internationally, some of the rights we
   cover will not due to the US Supreme Court holding radically narrow
   interpretation of the rights of individuals and radically wide
   interpretations for the rights of corporations and governments. Some
   of the rights we cover will be derived not from existing legal
   theory, but from a common sense reading of the definition provided
   above.</p>
   <p>The greatest thing about this country is the people’s enshrined
   right to elect representatives to make laws and amend the
   constitution in accordance with our own interpretation of rights.
   <strong>The will of the people should outweigh the will of the
   lawyers</strong>.</p>
