    <h1>Welcome to the Uncommon Sense Project</h1>
    <h6>This welcome was written by Nick B (see author <a
href="bio.html">bio</a>)</h6>

   <p><strong>This project is focused on securing the <em><a
   href="rights.html">rights</a></em> of people living in the United
   States through common sense public policy and law</strong></p>
   <p>Public trust, the percent who say they trust the government to do
   what is right at least most of the time, peaked around 1964 at 77
   percent. That public trust had eroded to under 25 percent by 2007 and
   has hovered around 20 percent ever since. <a href="#fn1"
   class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
   role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
   <p>When looking at the historical approval ratings of our elected
   branches of government, congressional approval ratings <a href="#fn2"
   class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>
   are consistently well below that of the president <a href="#fn3"
   class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>.
   A fact that, in hindsight, makes the country’s recent turn toward
   increased executive power all but inevitable. Also a fact that is
   entirely unsurprising given sustained congressional inaction.
   Seemingly the only time congress agrees is when it is to further
   strip people of their rights. Despite countless examples of the
   public and scientific evidence agreeing, congress continues to be
   nonsensible. <strong>It has been made damagingly clear that a large
   portion of the public feel that the only thing worse than executive
   overreach is inaction.</strong></p>
   <p>Now faced with unprecedented executive overreach that <strong>will
   exacerbate the issues</strong> faced by people living in the United
   States, restoring sense to Congress is our most immediate remedy.
   With this aim in mind, this project is an admittedly arrogant attempt
   to impart uncommon knowledge about the real <em><a
   href="issues.html">issues</a></em>. We will cover how these issues
   are related to your rights, what the common person thinks, and the
   common sense <em><a href="solutions.html">solutions</a></em> that
   have been met by congressional inaction.</p>
