    <h1>Welcome to the Uncommon Sense Project</h1>
    <h6>This welcome was written by Nick B (see author <a
href="bio.html">bio</a>)</h6>

   <p><strong>This project is focused on securing the <em><a
   href="rights.html">rights</a></em> of people living in the United
   States through common sense public policy and law</strong></p>
   <p>Public trust, the percent who say they trust the government to do
   what is right at least most of the time, peaked around 1964 at 77
   percent. That public trust had eroded to under 25 percent by 2007 and
   has hovered around 20 percent ever since. <a href="#fn1"
   class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
   role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
   <p>When looking at the historical approval ratings of our elected
   branches of government, congressional approval ratings <a href="#fn2"
   class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>
   are consistently well below that of the president <a href="#fn3"
   class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>.
   This pattern likely reflects sustained congressional inaction on
   issues and solutions with public and scientific agreement. The trend
   also helps explain our recent turn toward increased executive power
   with it being made damagingly clear that <strong>a large portion of
   the public feel that the only thing worse than executive overreach is
   congressional inaction.</strong></p>
   <p>Now faced with unprecedented executive overreach that <strong>will
   exacerbate the issues</strong> faced by people living in the United
   States, restoring sense to Congress is our most immediate remedy. In
   1776, Congress wrote:</p>
   <blockquote>
   <p>“We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created
   equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain
   unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the
   pursuit of Happiness. That whenever any Form of Government becomes
   destructive of these ends, <strong>it is the Right of the People to
   alter or to abolish it</strong>, and to institute new Government,
   laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in
   such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety
   and Happiness.” <a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"
   role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
   </blockquote>
   <p><strong>This project asserts that modern day congress has become a
   destructive force that can and should be fundamentally altered in the
   radical pursuit of life, liberty, and happiness</strong></p>
