<p><strong>This project is focused on securing the <em><a
href="rights.html">rights</a></em> of people living in the United States
through common sense public policy and law</strong></p>
<p>Public trust, the percent who say they trust the government to do
what is right at least most of the time, peaked around 1964 at 77
percent. That public trust had eroded to under 25 percent by 2007 and
has hovered around 20 percent for nearly two decades. <a href="#fn1"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>
<strong>That means that despite nine major federal elections, only 1 in
5 people can ever trust our government.</strong></p>
<p>When looking at the historical approval ratings of our elected
branches of government, congressional approval ratings <a href="#fn2"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> are
consistently well below that of the president <a href="#fn3"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>.
This pattern likely reflects sustained congressional inaction on issues
and solutions with public and scientific agreement. The trend also helps
explain our recent turn toward increased executive power with it being
made damagingly clear that <strong>a large portion of the public feel
that the only thing worse than executive overreach is congressional
inaction.</strong></p>
<p>Now faced with unprecedented executive overreach that <strong>will
exacerbate the issues</strong> faced by people living in the United
States, restoring sense to Congress is our most immediate remedy. In
1776, Congress wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created
equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable
Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.
That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends,
<strong>it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish
it</strong>, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on
such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall
seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness.” <a href="#fn4"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>This project asserts that congress has become a destructive
force that can and should be fundamentally altered in the radical
pursuit of life, liberty, and happiness</strong></p>
